The programs are mainly developed based on the library ‘matplotlib’ of python. Their main function is to read the post-processed data of the primary computing software VASP and plot it for subsequent analysis. I developed these codes during my undergraduate graduation project, and they may seem childish and ridiculous due to my limited skill and time and energy. In fact, it seems that there are already relatively mature third-party libraries ‘py4vasp’ and ‘pymatgen’. I will try to use these libraries next time I have the chance. Welcome your valuable comments and suggestions.
